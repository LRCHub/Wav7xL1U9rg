[00:15.81] I was just a joker in a serious game
[00:19.72] I didn't have the heart to play
[00:23.53] But sooner or later
[00:26.79] I'll find a reason to throw it away
[00:44.29] 
[00:31.58] Risin' on the crest of a natural wave
[00:35.07] That never seems to break my way
[00:39.05] I'm livin' without it
[00:42.50] But I got to do somethin' about it
[00:59.50] 
[00:47.03] Step by step
[00:49.95] Little by little (move a little closer to me)
[00:54.67] Step by step
[00:56.89] Take it line by line (one day at a time)
[01:02.38] Move, move, move
[01:04.91] Move a little closer (move a little closer to me)
[01:09.10] Step by step
[01:12.37] The deal is mine
[01:20.37] 
[01:21.54] I was just a runner in a one-horse race
[01:25.79] Livin' on the don't pass line
[01:29.49] Sooner or later
[01:32.63] I got to lose 'cause I'm wastin' my time
[01:52.63] 
[01:37.40] Lady Luck must have been a wonderful girl
[01:40.86] She's never been a friend of mine
[01:44.99] I'm livin' without her
[01:48.27] But I still got that mountain to climb
[02:07.27] 
[01:52.69] Step by step
[01:55.65] Little by little (move a little closer to me)
[02:00.31] Step by step
[02:02.71] Take it line by line (one day at a time)
[02:08.09] Move, move, move
[02:10.72] Move a little closer (move a little closer to me)
[02:15.63] Step by step
[02:18.00] The deal is mine
[02:26.00] 
[02:58.03] Step by step
[03:01.06] Little by little (move a little closer to me)
[03:05.70] Step by step
[03:07.82] Take it line by line (one day at a time)
[03:13.32] Move, move, move
[03:15.75] Move a little closer (move a little closer to me)
[03:20.92] Step by step
[03:23.06] Ooh, the deal is mine
