It's alright, it's not wrong
To sometimes feel
You're just hanging on
On those days when
Your feelings are low
Don't hold back
Just let those feelings show

If you want my time and devotion
You've got to give me
Some of your emotion
It's not too much, too much to ask
If you want this love to last
Born with open eyes
But you're blinded by confusion
Born with strength

Let's do it step by step
Into tomorrow
We can make it if we try
Just talk to me, walk with me
There's no reason why
Let's do it step by step
Into tomorrow with our open eyes
So come on talk to me
Just walk with me
You can do it if you try
One step, one step at a time
One heart beatin' with mine

Nothing gained, nothing ventured
Nothing won, no risk, no loss
In this world of indecisions
There's a bridge we all must cross
Born with open eyes
But you're blinded by confusion
Born with strength
