Vibrations crack the core of my heart

Turning passion into a spark

Charging my moves to perfection

That's what I call satisfaction.
Engaging my mind till I'm through

This is iust one
One of my moods

Get inside
Get inside

My body erupts with ecstasy

Raising my blood to onehundred degrees.

Step by step - check the trick

Step by step - and kick the kick

Step by step - don't move so quick

Step by step - like a lunatic.

The atmosphere meets my desire
Nimble limbs never get tired

Look in my eyes and watch the steps
See me turn down and back.
Engagincl my mind till I'm through

This is iust one
One of my moods

Get inside
Get inside
