I'm gonna take it step
By step

There is some kind of poison in disorder
Going step by step
So I'm gonna break on past the border
Going step by step
And feels like there's something in the air

I found a reason to stay
And then it faded away
And I'm already on
On my way out

I'm gonna take it step
As I try to find a new way forward
By step
An empty space that I am gone for

Going step by step
As I try to find a new way forward
By step
And feels like there's something in the air

I found a reason to stay
And then it faded away
And I'm already on
On my way out

I found a reason to stay
And then it faded away
And I'm already on
On my way out

I'm gonna take it step

I'm gonna take it step
I can feel the ground beneath me moving
By step
And feels like there's something in the air

I think I found a reason to stay
And then it faded away
And I'm already on
On my way out

I found a reason to stay
And then it faded away
And I'm already on
On my way out
I found a reason to stay

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
By step
By step
By step

I'm gonna take it step
